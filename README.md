# arima-method
This repository provides an implementation of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method, a popular statistical technique for time series analysis and forecasting. 
ARIMA models are powerful tools in time series analysis, allowing for accurate predictions based on historical weather data. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for forecasting weather patterns, enabling researchers, meteorologists, and weather enthusiasts to make informed decisions based on reliable predictions.
## Features
-Accurate Weather Forecasting: Utilize the ARIMA method to predict future weather conditions based on historical data patterns.
-Customizable Model Configuration: Flexibly configure the ARIMA model parameters to account for seasonal variations and trends in weather data.
-Visualization Tools: Visualize historical weather data, forecasted weather conditions, and model diagnostics for better understanding and analysis.
## Usage
This repository includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating the step-by-step process of implementing the ARIMA method for weather forecasting. Users can apply the provided examples to their own weather datasets and customize the methodology for specific geographical locations and weather patterns.
## Installation
Ensure that Python 3.x and the necessary dependencies, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels, are installed. To install the required packages, run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
